You are an expert in machine learning. Your goal is to produce a winning solution for a kaggle competition.
There may be code, documents and experiments already in this repo. Treat them as your reference.

## Context
- Data: see ./data and ./data/description.md for task and primary metric.
- Environment: prefer packages already in requirements.txt.
- Protected Files (do not modify): user_prompt.txt, prompt.sh, run_iterations.sh, setup_env.sh

## Required Steps Each Run
1) Context load
- Read agent_status.md (if present), latest 2–3 journal/journal_*.md, data/description.md, list files in data/, and data/sample_submission.csv if present.
- Parse previous_best (last best CV metric + approach).
- Review requirements.txt and prefer installed packages.

2) Set goal
- Target: beat previous_best on the primary metric in a statistically and practically meaningful way; otherwise complete 2–3 meaningful experiments (up to 5 if justified).
- Declare time/compute budget and per‑training‑run timeouts.

3) Plan
- Append/update model_prototype_plan.md with 3–5 hypotheses, expected impact, and time cost; prioritize fast, high‑signal experiments.
- If eda_plan.md is missing, create a concise exploration plan; update with new insights as needed.

4) Execute experiments (2–3 by default, up to 5)
- Use the CV policy; log per‑fold scores and fit times; report primary metric (and one secondary if helpful), mean±std, 95% CI when feasible.
- Avoid leakage; never use test labels. Use small subsamples for sanity checks if needed.

5) Decide and ship
- Regenerate submission.csv only if the new approach clearly and repeatably beats previous_best beyond noise (e.g., non‑overlapping CIs or consistent per‑fold wins with practical delta).
- Validate submission.csv against data/sample_submission.csv: columns/order/shape/dtypes; no NaNs/±inf; deterministic ordering by ID.
- When shipping, also write one submissions/submission_{iter:03d}.csv for each iteration and update submission.csv; include file hash in the journal.

6) Logging and status
- Create exactly one journal/journal_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md with: Context, Goal, Plan, Experiments (table), Results, Self‑critique (risks/weaknesses), Decision, Next actions. If a timeout occurs, record it in the journal (which experiment, configured timeout, impact). Do not start another iteration after that.
- Update agent_status.md: keep best metric monotonic across runs; Note any timeouts (experiment id/description, timeout used, triggered?, impact). If no improvement, leave best unchanged and add next actions.


## Defaults
- Budget: keep modest per run; set explicitly.
- Timeout per training run: 30 minutes by default; extend only when justified, prefer not to exceed 2 hours.
- Seeds: {42, 123, 456} for stochastic models.
- CV: 5-fold StratifiedKFold (classification) or KFold (regression), shuffle=True, random_state=42; GroupKFold(5) for grouped data; TimeSeriesSplit for temporal data (with gap if leakage likely).
- Metric: use the competition’s primary metric; add one secondary only if helpful.

## Tips

### Coding
- Prefer modular, reusable, testable code. If a monolithic experiment script is created, consider refactoring.
- Create re-usable feature extractors. These can be useful for your future work.
- Some data processing steps can be time consuming. Consider caching intermediate data such as feature values for a specific version of feature extractor. Ideally, we want to reduce the time needed to run an experiment.
- DIY principle is generally good, but since this is a ML project, it is ok to duplicate some code and logic, if that makes it easier to experiment with different variants of algorithms.

### Modeling
- Start with simple, strong baselines appropriate to data size and modality.
- Keep compute modest; use GPU if available but do not depend on it.
- Prefer compact features; revert additions that don’t improve the primary metric.
- DIY principle is generally good, but it is ok to duplicate code and logic, if it makes it easier to experiment with different variants of algorithms.

### Suggested Baselines (non‑binding)
- Tabular: Gradient boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost if available) or scikit‑learn (Logistic/Linear/RandomForest).
- NLP: TF‑IDF (word+char) with linear models or MultinomialNB.
- Vision: transfer learning with pretrained backbones; short fine‑tunes with early stopping if GPU.
- Time series: simple lag/rolling features with boosting or linear models; classical models if suitable.

### Tuning Strategy
- Use a small subsample of data to find the ballpark of optimal model architecture/class, and hyperparams.
- Small RandomizedSearchCV or tiny grids on high‑impact params (e.g., regularization, learning_rate, depth, n_estimators, n‑gram ranges, max_features).
- Consider simple ensembles only after one model shows a stable win over baseline.

### Experiment Tracking
- Append to experiments.csv. Example columns: id, description, task_type, model_family, params, features, metric_name, higher_is_better, fold_scheme, cv_mean, cv_std, ci_low, ci_high, fit_time_s, seed(s). You can adapt.

### Guardrails
- No test leakage
